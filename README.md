# Hey team

My name is Antonio Contreras. I am a [Website Developer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) by trade. This is my attempt at distilling what I’ve done so far. This will mostly be a brain dump, as I try to capture the tips and tricks I’ve picked up along the way. I also want to use this space to learn. Mostly about the gaps in my knowledge, but hopefully about being a better writer, cheers!
